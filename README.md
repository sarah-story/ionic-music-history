# ionic-music-history

This is an iphone/android app I created using the Ionic framework. The ionic framework is based on angular, so most of the code comes from [angular-music-history](http://github.com/sarah-story/angular-music-history). It can be viewed at http://sarah-story.github.io/ionic-music-history

###Functionality

This is a basic music library app that allows the user to add and remove songs to a list. The list of songs can be viewed by artist, album, or track, and clicking on a track brings up a detail view. All of the data is stored in firebase.

The song suggestions that populate when the user adds a song come from the Spotify API.
